        <h2>Take your first step towards Healing</h2>
        <p>
          You try to rely on time to heal your wounds, you have tried to move on, and you simply feel overwhelmed with sadness and torment again and again. The loss of a loved one is not the only thing that can bring grief. The loss of a relationship, divorce, abuse, loss of hopes, dreams, expectations, health, career, and home are just a few things that can feel completely devastating, making you wonder IF or HOW to go on and ever feel genuinely happy or even content

        <h3>It's time for something new...</h3>
        <img src="../../images/sitePhotos/iStock-858738352-min.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
          You try everything you have been taught, doing your best to move through the stages of grief you know about. Others give you advice trying to help, but it makes you feel dismissed, defective for not being over it yet. You pretend that things are fine to get people to stop giving you advice, while on the inside you are struggling, in anguish, and sobbing.
